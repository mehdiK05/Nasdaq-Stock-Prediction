Welcome to the Nasdaq Prediction with LSTM project! 🚀

This repository provides the code and resources for predicting Nasdaq stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. Leveraging the power of deep learning, our goal is to forecast stock trends and support informed investment decisions.
# Project Overview 💡
In this project, we utilize historical Nasdaq stock market data to train an LSTM model. By learning from past price patterns and trends, the model aims to predict future stock movements with greater accuracy. Designed to capture long-term dependencies, LSTMs have proven highly effective in time series forecasting, making them well-suited for stock price prediction.
# Model Training 💪🏻
The LSTM model is built using PyTorch, a powerful deep learning framework. We train the model on historical Nasdaq data, fine-tuning hyperparameters such as the number of hidden layers, neurons per layer, and learning rate. To enhance generalization and prevent overfitting.
# Results and Discussion 📊
This section showcases the outcomes of our Nasdaq stock prediction experiments. We evaluate the model’s effectiveness, discussing its advantages, challenges, and opportunities for enhancement. Furthermore, we include graphs and visual comparisons to illustrate how the predicted stock prices align with actual market trends.
